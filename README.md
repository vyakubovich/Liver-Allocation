# Single- and Multi-Agent Approaches to Equitable MELD-Driven Liver Allocation
This study addresses the challenge of liver transplant allocation, which requires balancing equity and patient survival under resource constraints. We first offer an approach that optimizes patient and graft lifespan, and then redefine the allocation process as a multi-agent stochastic game, where three patient risk groups—low, medium, and high—compete for organs using Nash Q-learning. Our contributions are the following: (1) a DQN-derived policy framework for maximizing life and transplant duration (2) a Nash Q-learning model, treating each risk group as an independent agent competing for resources, introducing strategic interactions; (3) we replace synthetic urgency distributions with real MELD score distributions, derived using advanced statistical modeling for clinical realism; (4) we achieve fairness under the Nash Q-learning regime via equilibrium, ensuring no group can unilaterally improve its allocation without adjusting to others; Results demonstrate similar lifespan performance to United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) through DQN, while the groupbased framework effectively promotes equity across risk
groups while maintaining high survival outcomes, highlighting its potential for developing equitable and effective organ allocation policies.
